=== WC Vendors - Stripe Connect Gateway ===


A payment gateway for Stripe (https://stripe.com/). A Stripe account and a server with SSL support/a valid SSL certificate is required (for security reasons) for this gateway to function.


Designed to work with WC Vendors to automatically pay vendors commission once an order is paid for with Stripe.  In order for the vendor to receive commission, they must connect to Stripe on their Vendor Dashboard's Shop Settings page.  When a buyer pays for a product using Stripe, and the Vendor is connected to stripe, automatic commission takes place and commissions are marked paid in the commission log.


== Important Note ==


You *must* enable SSL from the settings panel to use this plugin in a live environment - this is for your customers safety and security.
